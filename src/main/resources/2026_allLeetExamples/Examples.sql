Explanation:
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96

(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.
Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.
Write a solution to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

| name        | varchar  |
| reports_to  | int      |
| age         | int      |
+-------------+----------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null).

For this problem, we will consider a manager an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them. Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.
The result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input:  Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+

Employees Whose Manager Left the Company

+-------------+----------+
In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null).
 Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.
Return the result table ordered by employee_id.
The result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input:  Employees table:
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |

Output:

Explanation:
The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).
Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).
Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.
